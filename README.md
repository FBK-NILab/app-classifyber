### app-classifyber
This app segments white matter bundles by solving Anatomically-Informed multiple Linear Assignment Problems (multi-LAP-anat). The method is a supervised example-based segmentation method, and thus requires multiple bundles as examples to learn from. The segmentation is performed by means of fiber correspondence across subjects by considering both the shape of the fibers and their relative anatomical position.
